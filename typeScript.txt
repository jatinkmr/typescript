typeScript practice:
using node v18.13.1
using npm v9.1.2

installation :-

1) npm install typescript --save-dev //As dev dependency
2) npm install typescript -g //Install as a global module
3) npm install typescript@latest -g //Install latest if you have an older version

Verification :-
To verify the installation was successful, enter the command $ "tsc -v" in the Terminal Window.

After installing tsc run this following command to compile the code
tsc <fileName>.ts

After running the above command it'll generate ".js" file and now run that ".js" file using node command.

Run :-
node <fileName>.js


We can also install TS using tsc command, which helps us to Initialize any TS section. Following is the command for that
tsc --init

Now we don't need to compile by giving the name of file every time. We just simply run "tsc" which automatically compile all TS files.

The use of workflow is to segreage the public files from the soure files.

For maintaing the folder structure we've to follow the following steps :-
1) Initialize the project using "tsc --init" command. It'll initliazie or create a new file named "tsconfig.json" file which holdes all the information about the project. After initliazie project using above command. We don't have to specify filename everytime. We simple run "tsc" command which automatically compile the whole project.
2) Open "tsconfig.json" file and edit 2 property having name "rootDir" and "outDir" acc to your project structure.
"rootDir": "./src" --> will contain the source folder of the project
"outDir": "./public" --> will contain the output folder of the project
3) But the main trouble is if we create any file having ".ts" extension. It'll also get compile and make their corresponding compiled ".js" fle. To eliminate this type of error, we've to insert a new property into "tsconfig.json" file after "compilerOption" with having name as "include" which may contain the array of folder with source file location. In our case which is "src" folder.
After doing step your "tsconfig.json" file will look like this :
{
    "compilerOptions": {...},
    "include": ["src"]
}

Aliases

TypeScript allows types to be defined separately from the variables that use them.
Aliases allows types to be easily shared between different variables/objects.

or in simple words we can say that, An alias is an additional name of any type whether it'll be a string, object or an array

1) "type" Aliases can be used for primitives like string or more complex types such as objects and arrays.

syntax for providing any Aliases
type <Alias_Name> = <Alias_Value>
eg..,
type StringOrNum = string | number;
type objWithPropsType = { name: string, uid: StringOrNum };
